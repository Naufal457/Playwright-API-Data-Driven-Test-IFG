# Playwright-API-Data-Driven-Test-IFG
This project enables data-driven API testing using Playwright Test. It reads input data from a JSON file and dynamically sends requests to an API endpoint, validating responses automatically. Ideal for testing fraud-check APIs, verifying dynamic payloads, and integrating into CI/CD workflows.
